# JS Graveyard (RESURRECTED)

Pure Javascript and jQuery prototypes that failed to make the cut.

## About

They had so much promise, but the differences in browser implementations killed them.

Most of the issues I have faced, as you will immediately notice when running these scripts on varying web browsers is related to animation performance, specifically Internet Explorer.  I am hoping to revive these scripts someday when Microsoft finally releases a web browser that somewhat follows standards.  ~~Until that day, I wait patiently~~.

## Repository

The scripts added within this repository normally will come in pairs.  One is implemented in jQuery and one using Pure Javascript.  I generally take this approach to weight performance across the different implementations.

## Usage

These scripts come with no documentation or warranties.  Feel free to use them, but be wary.
